# Hybrid Model Justification

"""
Why Hybrid AttentionGNN-LSTM is Superior to Individual GNN or LSTM Models

- GNNs excel at modeling relationships and structures in transaction graphs (e.g., user-merchant interactions), but cannot capture the temporal order or sequence of transactions.
- LSTMs are powerful for learning temporal dependencies in transaction sequences, but ignore the relational/graph context (e.g., fraud rings, merchant-user networks).
- Real-world fraud patterns are both sequential (evolving over time) and relational (involving multiple entities and connections).

**Hybrid Model Advantages:**
- Combines GNN's ability to model graph structure with LSTM's strength in temporal modeling.
- Attention mechanism further enhances the model by focusing on the most relevant parts of the sequence and graph.
- Empirically, hybrid models achieve higher accuracy, recall, and robustness to concept drift and sophisticated fraud patterns.

**Summary Table:**
| Model      | Graph Awareness | Temporal Awareness | Handles Concept Drift | Robustness | Accuracy (Expected) |
|------------|----------------|-------------------|----------------------|------------|--------------------|
| GNN        | Yes            | No                | Limited              | Moderate   | Medium             |
| LSTM       | No             | Yes               | Limited              | Moderate   | Medium             |
| Hybrid     | Yes            | Yes               | Strong               | High       | High               |

**Conclusion:**
The hybrid AttentionGNN-LSTM model is better suited for credit card fraud detection as it leverages both graph and temporal information, adapts to evolving fraud patterns, and delivers superior performance compared to individual models.
